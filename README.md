# Why "TracePad"?
The name TracePad is inspired by the app’s core purpose:

* Trace: Refers to drawing, outlining, or signing—key actions you can perform with the app.
* Pad: Represents both your laptop’s touchpad (used as the input device) and a digital notepad or canvas.

TracePad turns your touchpad into a simple, creative space for sketching, doodling, or capturing signatures. The name reflects the app’s focus on intuitive, touch-based drawing and signing.
