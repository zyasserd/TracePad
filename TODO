# TO LEARN
- python learn
	- named / positional parameters
	- type hinting in 'Type'

- read the code and understand it properly

- good method to write commits


# TO DO
- make the color with curves
- TODOs

- organize the project files
- test

- license

- publication
	- fill the about information
		- name
		- icon

# MAYBE
- (BUG) highlighter rendering issue when lingering
	- too many points causes it to jitter

# NOTES
- taking control over the pointer
	- it's really hard to do that in wayland. So, I just decided to go fullscreen and then hide the pointer


- reference
	- https://github.com/Wazzaps/fingerpaint
	- apps created by python and nix
		- https://github.com/knoopx/vibeapps/blob/main/apps/launcher/launcher.py
	- use GTK4 + libadwaita
		- Libadwaita
		- https://github.com/Taiko2k/GTK4PythonTutorial


- uses
	- handwriting signature
	- doodling / notes
		- maybe handwriting recognition?
	- detexify
		- https://github.com/QuarticCat/detypify 
	- geometry app


# LATER
- UI reform
	- see lots of gtk code examples
	- use blueprint and fully libadwaita
		- error for 1.5
			- can't get the `AdwShortcutsDialog`

- Save preferences

- (feature) browse notes
	- open file
	- need own file format (or import from svg?)

- (EXTRA) real-time stroke smoothing / Path Smoothing Algorithms
	- is it needed
	- mostly use a library or sth for that don't do it manually
